For convenience of user, who will build fityk from source (from tarball,
not from SVN -- if you downloaded fityk from SVN, you have to first install
these dependencies), following dependencies are distributed with fityk:

* Spirit 1.8.2 (without docs, examples etc. See http://spirit.sf.net 
                for details. Spirit consists only of header files)

* additional Boost headers - some of them are distributed with Spirit as 
  'miniboost', other are required by xylib

* xylib - also in SVN, see xylib/README
