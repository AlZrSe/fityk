For convenience of user, who will build fityk from source (from tarball,
not from SVN -- if you downloaded fityk from SVN, you have to first install
these dependencies), following dependencies are distributed with fityk:

* Boost.Spirit 1.8.4 (without docs, examples etc. See http://spirit.sf.net 
                for details. Spirit consists only of header files)

* additional Boost headers - some of them are required by Spirit (and are
  distributed with Spirit as 'miniboost'), other are required by xylib.

* sglite - AFAIK this library is not available separately.
  See http://cctbx.sourceforge.net/current/history_sgtbx.html for more info.
  I needed something simpler than sgtbx and the author SgLite and sgtbx,

    I recommend you use sglite from the PyMOL sourceforge site (get via svn).
    In the license, replace PyMOL with the name of your program.
  This library is linked statically and not installed.
