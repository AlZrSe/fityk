User-visible changes in version 0.7.5  (2006-07-2 ):
* user defined functions (UDF) 
* GUI: gradient dialog for changing color of many datasets at once
* GUI: new Fit->Run dialog
* So-called domain of simple-variables can be specified ($a = ~3.5 [3 +- 2]),
  it is used only for randomization of the variable by some fitting methods.
* "info" can be redirected to file using "info ... > filename" syntax 
   to truncate the file and "info ... >> file" to appends to the file
* variables with names starting with "_" are auto-deleted when not used
* parameters of Lev-Mar methods can be changed (it was disabled in 0.7.0)
* GUI: pressing Shift in data range mode allows (dis)activate data in rectangle
* r-squared shown in "info fit" output (Emmanuel Lamprecht)
* a few bug fixes

User-visible changes in version 0.7.4  (2006-05-31):
* improved data and sum export
* GUI: optional grid in main plot (see axes configuration dialog) 
* defined function types can be undefined using "undefine Function" syntax
* with option=value[, option2=value2 ...] command ...
  sets value of options for this command only
* GUI: if cut-function-level is set, function limits are shown when cursor 
  is over peak top
* aggregate functions in data expressions: min, max, sum, avg, stddev, darea 
  eg. min(y if 20<x<25)
* "commands[n:m]" replaced with "info commands[n:m]"
* GUI: option "reverse" in auxiliary plot 
* GUI: background removing can be undone (like in version 0.4)
* gamma function for data transformations and variables.
* built-in area-based Pearson VII function.

User-visible changes in version 0.7.3  (2006-04-11):
* extended data transformations: numarea(%f, x1, x2, n) gives area integrated
  numerically (from x1 to x2, n steps), Y = y-%f(x) substracts function from
  data, findx(%f, x1, x2, y) finds x in (x1, x2) such that %f(x)=y,
  extremum(%f, x1, x2) finds x in (x1, x2) such that %f'(x)=0,
  transformations can be joined with ',' (previously '&' was used),
  randuniform(a, b), randnormal(mu, sigma) generate random numbers,
  y[x=21] gives y at x=21 using linear interpolation between two points
* user defined functions derived from other functions, eg:
   define Ga(area,center,hwhm) = Gaussian(area/fwhm/sqrt(pi*ln(2)),center,hwhm)
* optional logarithmic scaling of y axis
* bug fixes (Debian Bug #360795 and others) 

User-visible changes in version 0.7.2  (2006-03-08):
* area-based Voigt function (VoigtA)

* new functions: EMG (expotentially modified gauss) and Doniach-Sunjic
* GUI: fixes and improvements in printing
* GUI: new aux. plot type: cumulative chi2 
* minor bug fixes

User-visible changes in version 0.7.0  (2006-02-08):
* program can be compiled with unicode-enabled wxWidgets
* GUI: more configurable axes (eg. a reversed x axis option)
  and peak labels (eg. horizontal/vertical labels)

User-visible changes in version 0.7.0pre1  (2006-01-23):
* ###########################################################################
  #                      completely changed syntax                          #
  ###########################################################################
* GUI: dataset/function/variable lists at right-hand panel
* new built-in functions: split-Gaussian (a.k.a Bifurcated Gaussian) and others
* there where many other changes not listed here. More then half of the
  code was either written from scratch or refactored.
* some features available in previous version are temporarily disabled,
  most notably:  
     powder diffraction part - c.xxx commands
     parameters history

User-visible changes in version 0.5.1 (2005-07-21):
* new toolbar icons 
* data tranformations: treat "3 < x < 4" like "3 < x and x < 4"
* GUI data viewer - "Fit Zoom" button 


User-visible changes in version 0.5.0 (2005-06-09):
* d.load -- possibility of loading of only selected points from file 
            was removed (it can be done with d.tranform after loading)
            new option: adding data points from file to currently loaded data 
* d.transform  --  new quite powerful command for transforming data, 
  Commands d.deviation, d.range, d.background, d.calibrate, d.set were removed.
  Handling of background (and calibration) is now a little different.

  by wxTextCtrl)

User-visible changes in version 0.4.3:

* data files (in addition to scripts) can be specified as command line 
  arguments to fityk-GUI. Scripts should either have .fit or .fityk extensions
  or start with "# Fityk" string. 
* crosshair cursor (GUI->Crosshair cursor)
* "Data->Load File" dialog (simple) allows to open many files

  Now LC_NUMERIC variable is ignored. (Vincent Favre-Nicolin)
* new configure flags: --enable-debug and --enable-optimization 
* ambiguous 'log(2)' in "export as function" was replaced by numeric value
  (in gnuplot log means natural log, in Excel log=log10). 
* program version is written in scripts (session dumps and log files) 
  and in configuration files

User-visible changes in version 0.4.1:

* two independent auxiliary plots (by default one is visible)
* implemented s.guess command that adjusts existing peak - also in peak pop-up 
  menu (based on patch sent by Jonathan Hunt)
* config file can store info, what windows are visible (see GUI->Show)
