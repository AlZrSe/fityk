For compilation instructions read file INSTALL. 

Recent (second half of 2002) popular linux distributions have default encoding
set to UTF-8.  In case of problems with fonts just change encoding.

If your system uses comma(,) as a decimal point, run fityk in this way:
bash$ LC_NUMERIC=en_US fityk 
This problem will be fixed later.

If anything doesn't work as expected, contact fityk-users mailing list
or author. See fityk.sf.net for details.
