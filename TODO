* WIN32: make output window scroll when there is a new output  

* default vertical zoom should contain both data points and whole sum

* (GUI) export file-dialogs - (d.export and s.export) default filenames in GUI

* Data::load_arrays() method 

* www page with links to various peak-fitting programs, based on results
  of survey:  Peakfit (v.3 & 4), Origin+PFM, 
  peaksolve&GRAMS/32 (www.galactic.com), kaleidagraph (www.synergy.com),
  http://www.uksaf.org/software.html#1, lorentz.sf.net, graphpad prism,
  http://www.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/~surface/XPSPEAK/,
  http://escalab.snu.ac.kr/~berd/Fitt/fitt.html
  MDI Shadow (http://www.materialsdata.com/products.htm?), Jade, 
  GSAS, FullProf, CelRef, Powdercell
  WinPLOTR, WinFit, gnuplot,grace/xmgr,fudgit,qtiplot, paw/root (cern.ch)
  TableCurve, SigmaPlot

* update webpage - screenshots, features, etc.

---- [ 0.4.4 release ]

* problem: fityk can't be compiled with UNICODE-enabled wxWidgets

* write a good portable .spec (spec is used for building RPM)

* d.transform  --  new powerful command for transforming data, 
      that will replace d.deviation, d.range(?). It is partially done
      (as a separate program) using boost::spirit. Examples:
      d.transform Y[n>0] = Y[n-1] + y[n]     -> will integrate data
      d.transform S = sqrt(max(1,y[n]))      -> will set std. dev.
      d.transform x=y & y=x                  -> will swap x and y axes 

* GUI for d.transform command 

* (GUI) Data->Revert, datapane - "duplicate" command 

* auto-freezing of peaks at disactivated range

* integrate m.findpeak and s.add options. Prepare interface for many
  peak detection algorithms

* document s.guess command 

* logarithmic scale  

* More visible toolbar icons (icons 5-9 from left must be changed).
  Perhaps bigger (24x24) icons should be used?

* (s.add) possibility to add description of peak/parameter 
  This description could be used e.g. in exporting files.

* loading data -- use Difdaf library (when it will be ready) for powder
  diffraction data import.
  other formats (from survey): .jdx JCAMP-DX (www.jcamp.org)
		         Galactic (GRAMS/32) SPC files (especially multifiles)

* (loading data) -- merging a few files
  rewrite loading ASCII data 
  change order of arguments in syntax of d.load command 

* (GUI) redesign "Load File Custom" dialog 

* (GUI) one dialog for plot settings. More precise configuration of axis tics.
  horizontal/vertical peak labels, etc.

* (d.set) min-background-points-distance should be automatically changed 
  whan loading data to (xmax-xmin)/A

* rewrite scanner/parser using boost::spirit. Now it uses flex/bison.
  [IMPORTANT]

* user defined functions; it includes symbolic computing of derivatives.
  Important but needs a lot of work. Perhaps the idea of simple parameters,
  compund-parameters and functions will be revised. 
  [IMPORTANT]

* python scripts  -- built-in Python interpreter which allows to extend 
  Fityk using user-written scripts, optional modules, etc. 
  [IMPORTANT]

* rewrite crystallographic part in python
  [IMPORTANT]

* (GUI) stopping fitting interactively (when user don't want to wait longer);
  use threads?

* automatic background substraction - what algorithm is good?

* (s.export) when exporting function/sum as points, it shuld be possible 
  to set step of these points (s.set export-points-step = 0.?)
  and to export baseline and each peak as a separately (multicolumn CSV)

* subtract fitted functions from the real data ie for peak removal

* (Windows only) exporting plots to PostScript file and to metafile(clipboard) 

* problem: MS Windows - tree at data pane looks bad

* more sophisticated algorithms for peak detection

* write documentation for fwhm-correction and height-correction (m.set) 

* (GUI) single ergonomic interface changing colors of everything

* short-cuts for menu commands (Ctrl-O, F1, etc.)

* improve Voigt function (FWHM, cut-tails, better approx?) 

* fitting: it should be separated even more from the rest of the program.
  Perhaps it fitting functions should be in extern library (AFAIK there 
  is no such libary -- with unified interface to various nonlinear 
  optimisation methods). 
  Add more methods, eg. simulated annealing 

* fitting: robust fit - other error distributions then Gaussian, 
  eg. Lorenzian...; so called 'maximum-likelihood method' -- using Poisson
  error distribution.

* f.info -- more informations about error, confidence limits, etc.
  graphical interface to f.info; 
  easy way to get (write to file) parameters with errors [IMPORTANT]

* Now only '.' is supported as a decimal separator. ',' should also
  be an option.
