* improve Voigt function (probably bug in FWHM, cut-tails, better approx?) 

* data tranformations: new functions: randuniform[a b]() randnormal[mu sigma]()
                       temporary variables
		       documentation
		       transform title="new title here"

* (GUI) datapane - editable labels (titles)
                  "duplicate" command, when right-clicking on inactive label
		  [new dataset: title1 + title2] menu item

* problem: MS Windows - tree at data pane looks bad

* peak positions as an option to any aux. plot (not separate type of aux.p.)
* new aux. plot type: cumulative chi2 (normalized, ie. cum. chi2 / (N-P))
* (GUI) show function limits when cursor is over peak top
* [del] button at data pane
* view with/without background button (like in 0.4.x, requires storing
  background points)

------------------ 0.5.2  2005.0?

* user defined functions: 
      - parsing string into AST [DONE]
      - symbolic calculations of derivatives [DONE] 
      - simplifying equations and CSE [partially DONE]
      - changing the idea of simple parameters, compund-parameters 
        and functions. Rewritting computations of sum/functions values.
	Major changes in syntax. Joining transform with functions.
      - calculating limits, width, area, etc. for UDF

------------------ 0.6.0 2005.??

* problem: fityk can't be compiled with UNICODE-enabled wxWidgets

* (WWW) update screenshots 

* there are problems with refreshing plots and output window when program
  is busy (ie. when running script or fitting). It seems to be platform
  dependent.

* write a good portable .spec (spec is used for building RPM)

* auto-freezing of peaks at disactivated range

* (GUI) file preview (in grid) in "Load File Custom" dialog 
  setting initial path to currently loaded file (calling SetPath() 
  is giving segfault, don't know why) 
  Perhaps use wxGenericFileDialog instead of wxGenericDirCtrl (?)

* integrate m.findpeak and s.add options. Prepare interface for many
  peak detection algorithms

* document s.guess command 

* logarithmic scale  

* (s.add) possibility to add description of peak/parameter 
  This description could be used e.g. in exporting files.

* loading data -- use Difdaf library (when it will be ready) for powder
  diffraction data import.
  other formats (from survey): .jdx JCAMP-DX (www.jcamp.org)
		         Galactic (GRAMS/32) SPC files (especially multifiles)

* (GUI) one dialog for plot settings. More precise configuration of axis tics.
  horizontal/vertical peak labels, etc.
  single ergonomic interface changing colors of everything

* rewrite scanner/parser using boost::spirit. Now it uses flex/bison.
  [IMPORTANT]

* python scripts  -- built-in Python interpreter which allows to extend 
  Fityk using user-written scripts, optional modules, etc. 
  [IMPORTANT]

* rewrite crystallographic part in python
  [IMPORTANT]

* (GUI) stopping fitting interactively (when user don't want to wait longer);
  use threads?

* automatic background substraction - what are good algorithms?

* (s.export) when exporting function/sum as points, it shuld be possible 
  to set step of these points (s.set export-points-step = 0.?)
  and to export baseline and each peak as a separately (multicolumn CSV)

* possibility to subtract fitted functions from the data (ie peak removal)

* (Windows only) exporting plots to PostScript file and to metafile(clipboard) 

* more sophisticated algorithms for peak detection

* write documentation for fwhm-correction and height-correction (m.set) 

* fitting: it should be separated even more from the rest of the program.
  Perhaps it fitting functions should be in extern library (COOOL,
  GAUL, WNLIB, netlib, OOL.sf.net
  are there any other such libraries? 
  I haven't investigated the possibility of using mentioned libs yet. 
  Links: http://coool.mines.edu/ http://gaul.sourceforge.net/,

  http://sal.jyu.fi/B/3/index.shtml, http://coin-or.org,
  http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/otc/Guide/faq/nonlinear-programming-faq.html) 

* fitting: robust fit - other error distributions then Gaussian, 
  eg. Lorenzian...; so called 'maximum-likelihood method' -- using Poisson
  error distribution.

* f.info -- more informations about error, confidence limits, etc.
  graphical interface to f.info; 
  easy way to get (write to file) parameters with errors [IMPORTANT]

* Now only '.' is supported as a decimal separator. ',' should also
  be an option.
