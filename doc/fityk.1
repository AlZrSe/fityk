.SH NAME
fityk \- non-linear curve fitting and data analysis
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fityk
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILE\fR]...
.br
.B cfityk
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manpage documents briefly the
.B fityk
and
.B cfityk
programs for nonlinear fitting of analytical
functions (especially peak-shaped) to data (usually experimental data). In
other words, for nonlinear peak separation and analysis.
.br
It was developed for analyzing diffraction patterns, but can be also used in
other fields, since concepts and operations specific for crystallography are
separated from the rest of the program.
.br
Fityk offers various nonlinear fitting methods, subtracting background,
calibrating data, easy placement of peaks and changing peak parameters,
automation of common tasks with scripts, and much more. The main advantage
of the program is a flexibility - parameters of peaks can be arbitrarily
binded with each other, eg. width of peak can be an independent variable,
can be the same as width of other peak or can be given by complicated -
common for all peaks - formula.
.br
The program comes in two versions:
.B fityk
, the GUI version and
.B cfityk
, the command line version.
.br
A user manual for
.B fityk
and
.B cfityk
can be found in /usr/share/doc/fityk/html/fityk-manual.html.
